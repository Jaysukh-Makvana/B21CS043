12.

- SLEEPING: A process enters the sleeping state when it performs a system call that causes it to wait for an event, such as I/O completion or a signal.
- RUNNABLE: A runnable process is ready to be executed but is not currently running on the CPU. The process is waiting in the ready queue for its turn to be scheduled.
- RUNNING: A running process is currently executing on the CPU. It has control of the CPU and is progressing through its instructions.

13. The file system in XV6 is a simple file system with key components:
    Superblock: Contains metadata about the file system.
    Inodes: Store information about files and directories.
    Data blocks: Store the actual file data.
    Directory structure: Organizes files and directories.

14. System calls are a mechanism for user-space programs to request services from the kernel. Library functions are functions provided by the operating system that can be called from user-space programs.
    Examples of system calls in XV6 include:

open(): Opens a file
read(): Reads data from a file
write(): Writes data to a file
exit(): Terminates a process
Examples of library functions in XV6 include:

printf(): Formats and prints output to the console
scanf(): Reads input from the console
malloc(): Allocates memory
free(): Frees memory

15. Memory paging is a memory management technique that divides the physical memory into frames and the logical memory into pages. When a process accesses a memory address, the page table is used to translate the address into a physical frame.
    Benefits of using paging in memory management:

16.

- ls : is used to show list of files
- cd : change directory
- rm : for delete the file

17.

- Process synchronization in XV6 ensures orderly execution, preventing data inconsistency, race conditions, and deadlocks. Key mechanisms include locks, semaphores, conditional variables, spinlocks, and atomic operations.
- These maintain data integrity and control concurrent access to shared resources, essential for the reliable functioning of the operating system.

18. Interrupts are signals that are sent to the CPU to notify it of an event, such as a user pressing a key or a device completing an operation.
    Interrupts are handled by the interrupt handler, which is a piece of code that is specifically designed to handle the interrupt. The interrupt handler performs whatever actions are necessary to respond to the interrupt, such as reading input from the keyboard or writing data to disk.

Interrupts are important because they allow the operating system to respond to events in a timely manner. Without interrupts, the CPU would have to constantly poll devices for input, which would be inefficient.

19. Virtual memory is a memory management technique that creates the illusion that each process has its own private memory space. This is done by mapping the virtual memory addresses of the process to physical memory addresses.
    Advantages of using virtual memory:

Increased memory capacity: Virtual memory allows processes to have more memory than is physically available.
Protection: Virtual memory prevents processes from accessing each other's memory, which can help to protect the security of the system.
Flexibility: Virtual memory can be used to easily swap processes in and out of memory, which can be helpful for managing system load.

20. Involves BIOS/UEFI initialization, bootloader (e.g., GRUB), loading the kernel, and transitioning to protected mode.
    The XV6 kernel initializes the system, sets up paging, and launches the init process.
